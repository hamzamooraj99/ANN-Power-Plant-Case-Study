# ANN-Power-Plant-Case-Study
This is an Artificial Neural Network Regression Model that predicts the Electrical Energy Output of a Combined Cycle Power Plant.

## Dataset
The dataset was retrieved from the UCI Machine Learning Repository:<br>
- https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/294/combined+cycle+power+plant
<br>
The dataset includes 5 fields (4 independent variables and 1 dependant variable.
The 4 independent variables are as follows:
- Ambient Temperature (AT)
- Exhaust Vacuum (V)
- Ambient Pressure (AP)
- Relative Humidity (RH)
All variables were used to predict the dependant variable - The Net Hourly Electrical Energy Output (PE) of the plant.

## Implementation
I made use of a python notebook (.ipynb) to implement and train this ANN model. The model was made using the Tensorflow 2.0 library in Python.
